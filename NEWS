			Version 0.10 (03-Mar-2003)

* Ensure that all changes to generated files happen atomically.

* Change to half-text, half-binary format to make parsing the magic file
  much easier.

* Make it really clear that user prefs don't go in the database.

* Require libxml 2.4.0 (not sure if it's needed, but older versions seem a
  little buggy).

* Fix problem where copying nodes lost the namespace (workaround for libxml
  bug).

* Added DTD to freedesktop.org.xml.

* Spec was confused about whether a match type was an attribute or element
  name. Settled on attribute and updated XML (makes the DTD easier this way).

* Glob pattern for TGIF files.

* Added application/x-cd-image (requested by Stefano Peluchetti).

* Added text/x-uri (text/uri-list is used for something else).

* Added more extensions for powerpoint (Stefano Peluchetti).

  (requested by Vincent Lefevre).
