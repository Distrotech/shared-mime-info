This package contains:

- The freedesktop.org shared MIME database spec.
- The merged GNOME and KDE databases, in the new format.
- The update-mime-database command, used to install new MIME data.


To install:

Do the usual:
	
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

If you want to install to your home directory, change the last step to:

	$ make install mimedir=$HOME/.mime bindir=$HOME/bin

You'll need to make sure that $HOME/bin is in your PATH, of course.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info.html for more
information.
