A few ground rules for people interested in adding new mime-types.

* Mime-types used should be IANA registered mime-types when possible
* When old mime-types become registered, the new definition should
  include an alias for the old mime-type
* New entries or modifications should include a test case (see below)
* Mime-types/file formats proprietary to one application should only
  be added to a private .xml file and be bundled with the application
  itself

Translations
------------

Translations should go through the Translation Project at:
http://translationproject.org/latest/shared-mime-info/

Test suite
----------

You need to have xdgmime checked out and compile at the same level as
shared-mime-info. ../xdgmime/src/test-mime-data will be run against
tests/list.

The format of the file is:
<testcase filename> <expected mime-type> <expected failures>

The expected failures is whether matching the file with the mime-type would
fail when matched by file, data or name. "x" indicates expected failure, "o"
indicates expected success. Trailing "o"s can be omitted.
